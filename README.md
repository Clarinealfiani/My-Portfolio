# Profile

Hello there, welcome to my Portfolio!

I am Clarine Alfiani, who has an analytical background as Bachelor of Mathematics. As a person who has interest in the field of data processing, i am so excited to bring my technical and analytical skills in using data to uncover meaningful insights.

In order to improve my knowledge and skills, I joined study independent program as Data Analyst for 5 months. In this program, I successfully completed several projects including a case study on quantitative data analysis using Python and creating a dashboard related to illiteracy rates in Indonesia using Google Data Studio. Through those experiences, I have seen myself as a person who has critical & analytical thinking, problem solving, attention to detail, time management, and always willing to learn something new.

I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills, whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

Thank you for your time!

This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects.
