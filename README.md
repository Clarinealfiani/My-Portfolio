# Profile

Hello there, welcome to my Portfolio!

I am Clarine Alfiani, who has an analytical background as Bachelor of Mathematics. As a person who has interest in the field of data processing, i am so excited to bring my technical and analytical skills in using data to uncover meaningful insights.

In order to improve my knowledge and skills, I joined study independent program as Data Analyst for 5 months. In this program, I successfully completed several projects including a case study on quantitative data analysis using Python and creating a dashboard related to illiteracy rates in Indonesia using Google Data Studio. Through those experiences, I have seen myself as a person who has critical & analytical thinking, problem solving, attention to detail, time management, and always willing to learn something new.

I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills, whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

Thank you for your time!
